- **WebPageTest Location**: EC2 US East (N. Virginia)
- **Connection**: 4G (9 Mbps, 170ms RTT)
- **Browser**: Chrome
- **Test Runs**: 3 runs per test

## Core Web Vitals Assessment

### Local Development Environment
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: 1.65s ✅ (Good: < 2.5s)
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**: 120ms ✅ (Good: < 200ms)
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: 0.02 ✅ (Good: < 0.1)

### Production Environment
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: 2.15s ✅ (Good: < 2.5s)
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**: 220ms ⚠️ (Needs Improvement: 200ms - 600ms)
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: 0.03 ✅ (Good: < 0.1)

## Performance Gap Analysis

The performance gap between local and production environments is primarily due to:

1. **Network Latency**:
   - Production TTFB is 100ms higher than local
   - This impacts all subsequent metrics

2. **Additional Requests**:
   - Production makes 13 more requests than local
   - These additional requests are primarily for analytics and third-party scripts

3. **Increased Page Size**:
   - Production page is 200KB larger than local
   - Additional JavaScript and tracking code contributes to this difference

4. **JavaScript Execution**:
   - Total Blocking Time is 100ms higher in production
   - This indicates more CPU-intensive JavaScript execution

## Top Optimization Opportunities

1. **Reduce JavaScript Execution Time**:
   - Minimize or defer non-critical JavaScript
   - Consider code splitting to reduce initial bundle size

2. **Optimize Third-Party Resources**:
   - Load analytics and tracking scripts asynchronously
   - Consider using tag managers to control script loading

3. **Improve Server Response Time**:
   - Optimize backend processing
   - Consider CDN caching strategies

4. **Optimize Image Loading**:
   - Use responsive images with srcset
   - Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold images

5. **Implement Resource Hints**:
   - Use preconnect for critical third-party domains
   - Consider preloading critical resources

## Conclusion

The website performs well in both environments, with all Core Web Vitals passing on desktop in the local environment. The production environment shows slightly higher metrics due to real-world conditions, additional scripts, and network latency.

The most significant opportunity for improvement is reducing JavaScript execution time in the production environment, which would improve the Total Blocking Time metric.
